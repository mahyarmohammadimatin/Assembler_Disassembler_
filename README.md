In my Assembly course project, I implemented both an Assembler and a Disassembler in both Python and Assembly language.
This project aimed to explore the intricate process of converting assembly instructions into machine code and vice versa, providing valuable insights into the inner workings of computer systems and programming languages.

I developed a program that could take in assembly instructions as input and meticulously convert them into their corresponding machine code representation(vice versa in disassembeler). This involved parsing and analyzing the assembly instructions, mapping them to their respective opcodes, and generating the appropriate machine code sequences.
